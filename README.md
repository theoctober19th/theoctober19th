### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I'm bikalpa. I am from Pokhara, Nepal. In the internet, I am known by the name **theoctober19th**. I speak Python primarily, but can communicate in Java and JavaScript too. Other languages I'm familiar with are C, C++, C# and Swift.

I love to travel places, watch movies, listen to music and write code. I occasionally ring some stuffs in my guitar, but I won't say I hit the strings as good as I hit the keyboard. 

Lately I'm into YouTube, where I have a programming channel [https://youtube.com/BikalpaCodes?sub_confirmation=1](Bikalpa Codes).

Anything related to music, art and aviation fascinates me. I dream of joining flight school sometimes later in my life. A commercial pilot would be my profession had I not pursued IT.

I am a die-hard fan of George RR Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire' (though extremely disappointed with 'Game of Thrones' ending). Other shows I love are Mr. Robot, Rick and Morty, Sacred Games and Sherlock. I would jump into the vat of acid if Rick Sanchez asked me to.

Of all things that is eccentric about me, I warn you this my sarcasm level is beyond repair.

In case you want to invite me to coffee, or just say hi:
