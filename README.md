### Hi there 👋

I'm bikalpa. I am from Pokhara, Nepal. In the internet, I am known by the name **theoctober19th**. I speak Python and C primarily, but can communicate in Java and JavaScript too. Other languages I'm familiar with are C++, C#, Swift and Dart.

I love to travel to new places, watch cinema, listen to music and write code.

Lately I'm into YouTube, where I have a programming channel [Bikalpa Codes](https://youtube.com/BikalpaCodes?sub_confirmation=1).

Anything related to cinema and aviation fascinates me. In case you want to invite me to coffee, or just say hi:
