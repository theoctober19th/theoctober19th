### Hi there 👋

I'm bikalpa. I am from Pokhara, Nepal. In the internet, I am known by the name **theoctober19th**. I speak Python and C primarily, but can communicate in Java and JavaScript too. Other languages I'm familiar with are C++, C#, Swift and Dart.

I love to explore new places and watch cinema. I'm also quite interested in aviation, and lately into astrology and philosophy.
